## Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|
| [Issue Backends](./components/issue-backends.md) | The Issue Backend system provides a pluggable abstraction for issue tracking, allowing fab to work with multiple issue tracking systems (tk, GitHub Issues, Linear) through a unified interface. |
| [Supervisor](./components/supervisor.md) | The Supervisor is the central request handler for fab's daemon. |

## Verification
