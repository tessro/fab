## Components

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|----------|
| [Issue Backends](./components/issue-backends.md) | The Issue Backend system provides a pluggable abstraction for issue tracking, allowing fab to work with multiple issue tracking systems (tk, GitHub Issues, Linear) through a unified interface. |
| [Orchestrator](./components/orchestrator.md) | The Orchestrator manages the agent lifecycle for a project, spawning agents with isolated worktrees and coordinating merge/push operations. |
| [Supervisor](./components/supervisor.md) | The Supervisor is the central request handler for fab's daemon. |

## Verification

Build the documentation site to verify all docs render correctly:

```bash
make docs
# or directly:
go run ./cmd/docsite --source docs --out site/public/docs
```

## Examples

1. Navigate to [Components](#components) in this index
2. Click the [Supervisor](./components/supervisor.md) link in the table
3. The Supervisor doc explains the daemon's request handling, IPC messages, and configuration

### Discovering issue backend options

To understand which issue tracking backends fab supports:

1. Click [Issue Backends](./components/issue-backends.md) from the Components table
2. The doc covers tk (file-based), GitHub Issues, and Linear backends
3. Each backend section shows configuration examples in TOML format
